CODE BOOK FOR TIDY DATA ASSIGNMENT:
>>>> Ran out of time to complete the Code book
Key steps followed are:

1. Create the training, testing, subject data sets - These have no labels to start with
2. Create the training and testing label datasets
3. Combine the training and testing data sets into one (rowbind)
4. Combine the corresponding subject data sets into one (rowbind)
5. Combine the label datasets (to apply the labels to the combined data set later)
5. Load data features (labels) to a a features data frame
6. Create a mean/std vector that has the column numbers for the labels with mean and Std text strings
7. Subset the Combined data with only mean/Std columns
8. Clean up labels with gsub function
9. change column names replacing texts "mean" and "std" with "Mean" and "Std"
10. Remove "-" from column names in the combined data set
11. Clean up activity labels
12. Column bding the subjects, labels and combined data for the first set of clean data useable for functions
13. Using Dplyr function create the new data set with only means
14  Arrange the data by Subject
